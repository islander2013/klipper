<b> Resource for helping the move to euclid from klicky</b> 


The euclid hardware is great, but not so much on the software side. Even copying the euclid.cfg from the github/website had parsing / invalid spacing errors. Then there was a lack of macros.

klicky on the other hand has awesome software and macros...but has too many variables (glue + magnets + heat = not good) to be consistent on the hardware side.
I tried klicky / klickyNG / unklickyNG and each one had their own issues. Personally theres just too much inconsistency (user error, hardware differences) and I wanted a reliable peice of hardware with good software.

This is an attempt to help people transition to euclid from klicky.


<sub> <b> note: klicky is an awesome concept and the support/people behind it are amazing. It might work great for 99.9% of users and thats fine. But its not for everyone.
